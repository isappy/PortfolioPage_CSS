              Depletion Potential of Different Refrigerants in
              VCRS</strong></h2>
            <img src="/Project Report/1200px-Refrigeration_PV_diagram.svg.png" alt="VCRS Project">
            <p class="project1-writeup">Vapor-compression refrigeration or vapor-compression refrigeration system (VCRS),
              in which the refrigerant undergoes phase changes, is one of the many refrigeration
              cycles and is the most widely used method for air-conditioning of buildings and
              automobiles. It is also used in domestic and commercial refrigerators, large-scale
              warehouses for chilled or frozen storage of foods and meats, refrigerated trucks and
              railroad cars, and a host of other commercial and industrial services. <br>
              It can be shown that the GWP & ODP values of the blend mixture (R-22 + R-600a)
              will be lesser than of the commercial refrigerants, which are been used in the
              commercial refrigeration system.</p><br>

            <h2><strong>GARBAGE CONTAINER WITH AUTOMATIC OPENING/CLOSING AND MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE SUBJECT BY RESPONDING ELECTRONIC SIGNAL.</strong></h2>
            <img src="/Project Report/smartdustbin.jpg" alt="smartdustbin">
            <p class="project2-writeup">An improved garbage container with automatic opening and closing functions, in particular an improvement directed to large or medium size garbage container, including an electric-controlled sensing device i.e. ultra-sonic sensor will be fitted in front of the bin.
              The main purpose of this project is to provide electronic circuit that will be used to control dustbin door that will open automatically when somebody comes near it and will close automatically when somebody gets away from it. I have found that the existing dustbins commonly used have to be opened manually so they do not give good environment to use for those disabled people who lost one of their hands or feet. This is going to be a solution for this problem.</p><br>
